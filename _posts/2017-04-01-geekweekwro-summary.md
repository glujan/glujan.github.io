As some of you reading this may know, currently I live in Wrocław, beautiful
city in south-western Poland, sometimes referred to as _a city of hundred
bridges_ (it's a lie, we have more than that :)

During last week, from 27th of March to 1st of April, a cool event called
_GeekWeekWro_ took place. The idea was to engage some of many people working in
IT industry in Wrocław to go out and meet together in at least a few of 25
specialized meetups. With over 20 000 of IT employees (in a rougly 640 000
city) the wide variety of topics and pretty big number of meetings it should
not be a problem. And it wasn't :-) There was something for everyone, I
suppose: there was something for Go, Python, C#, data scientists, R or PHP
enthusiasts, business analysts, devops, quality assurance, databases admins …
and more.

During the last day a small conference took place. It was free of charge so
anyone could join. There were 4 speeches, all of them were given in Polish so
titles are translated to English by me (except the first one, which was already
in English). Topic covered:
 
 1. _Why every programmer should learn Go_ by Mateusz Dymiński. Mateusz tried
    to introduce Go and its advantages to those not familiar with this language
    and showed some easy to understand examples depicting using of goroutines,
    starting HTTP server and more.
 2. _Machine learning step by step_ by Tomasz Melcer. Tomasz introduced to the
    audience some basic concepts of machine learning and how to avoid common
    problems. There were also excellent examples which were confirming words
    spoken by Tomasz.
 3. _Internet of Things - on scale_ by Witalij Rudnicki. Witalij presented some
    application and plausible future of IoT in both commercial (or even -
    industrial) and personal use environments.
 4. _How to automation and monitoring helps deliver faster_ by Tomasz
    Tarczyński. Tomasz was talking about important aspects of developer
    operations and how did he and his colleagues from work solved problems with
    their IoT platform.

All speeches were interesting but my favourite one happen to be the one about
machine learning. Maybe because I would like to play with it a little bit in a
near future. To learn more about _GeekWeekWro_ visit the [official website] -
but it's only in Polish, sorry. Anyway, it was the third edition of this event
so I'm looking forward for the next one next year.

Grzegorz with a nice new sticker is a happy Grzegorz.

And why a dwarf is on a sticker, you may ask? Well, dwarves are one of Wrocław
symbols. If you visit a city, you can even [meet some of them], no kidding! As
of today a population is 165 (little) people and counting :-)
