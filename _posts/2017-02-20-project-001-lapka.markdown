The first project I will be describing on this blog is called _Łapka_. It is a
Polish name for _a paw_ which is a reasonable name for the app that will help
animals from shelters find a new home, isn't it?

Tech stack has not been chosen yet as I still have plenty of time to think
about it. Probably I will go with Python 3 for backend and for frontend - we'll
see. I know _Backbone.js_ only - which is probably considered _passé_ by JS
community, and probably this is a good enough excuse to learn something new.

_Łapka_ will take part in _Get Noticed!_ contest. All posts related to the
contest will have `GN17` label, as required by the organizer.
