I am Grzegorz and work as a software developer. Most of my duties is to
create web applications - I tend to use one of many Python's frameworks or Go
on my daily routine.

This blog was created to let me share my thoughts and concerns about my ~~toy~~
side projects, where I can play with any tech stack I want to. Except selection
of not related technologies used in never finished projects ;-)

You can find sources of this blog on my GitHub profile {% include icon-github.html username="glujan" %} /
[glujan.github.io](https://github.com/glujan/glujan.github.io).

It is powered by

with somewhat customized 
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
